# Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry. This project applies machine learning to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, using real-world telecom data and the XGBoost model. It emphasizes preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and handling imbalanced classes to create a robust predictive pipeline.

The data is sourced from IBM's Base Samples. More information about the data can be found here: https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113
